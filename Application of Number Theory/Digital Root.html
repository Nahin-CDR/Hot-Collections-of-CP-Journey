There is a formula, digital root = 1 + ((num-1)% 9)

Then, if you want to find the k-th largest num, just deform the above formula.

Finally: num = 9 * K + digital root (K = 0, 1, 2, 3 ......)

//Let me explain what does digital root means..
if 221 is a number. then its digital root will be ..
221 => 2+2+1 => 5 (calculate the sum of all digits until its become a single digit)
and thats Single digit is called the digital root of that first number
and here 5 is the digital root of 221
